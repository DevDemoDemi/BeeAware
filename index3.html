    <p id='col1Words'> US beekeepers lost an average of 40% of their honey bee colonies in 2018. Reports
      reveal that as much as 50% of
      the affected colonies and hives showed sudden disappearance symptoms (later established as death) of the worker
      bee populations. This occurred away from the colony, leaving the young and the queen behind, still with strong
      pollen and honey reserves.

      <p id="foodTextWords">Bees are the most dominant pollinators of wild and crop plants. They visit over 90% of the
        world’s top 107 crops. Bee decline statistics reveal that 71 of the 100 crop species that make up most of the
        global food supply depend on bee pollination. (Pollenity) Crop pollination is crucial for crop survival and,
        thus, feeding the world population. The value of the US food crops that depend on pollination by bees alone is
        estimated at $16 billion. Combining this with general insect pollinators, the number jumps to $29 billion.</p>

    <ul>

      <div id='wid30'>
        <li> The most common reason is the bees losing a lot of their habitat because of farming and urbanization.</li>
        <li>Fertilizers and pesticides used on crops, and even in your backyard, may kill other harmful pests, but
          they’re
          also killing bees.</li>
      </div>

      <li>Pesticides added to the seeds, entire plants, or the soil of plants that bees pollinate maybe effective in
        killing insects harmful to the crops, they are also deadly to bees.</li>
      <li>Varroa mites were the biggest problem in operations managing five or more colonies in 2018. (USDA)</li>
      <li>The USDA’s bee population chart shows this was the case throughout 2018, with April through June seeing the
        most significant portion of colonies affected by varroa mites (56.4%).</li>
      <li>Varroa mites affected 45.6% of these colonies from January through March 2019. These mites still pose the
        greatest risk for bee colonies, causing significant damage and high death rates throughout the year.</li>

  <h2 id="contact" class="heading">Contact us or local beekeeper</h2>

  <h2 class="heading" id='beeLandmark'>Bees use landmarks to orientate themselves</h2>

  <p id="landmarks" class="no_show">
    When bees are out foraging they use landmarks to orientate themselves back to their hive. They use
    polarized light to determine their relative speed to the landscape passing beneath them. Bees also have an internal
    honing device which works like a GPS to orientate themselves by magnetic variations around them. Once set in their
    memory, they don't need to reorientate each time they leave the hive, they know how to get back home, or at least
    they do until you move their hive, and this is where the problem starts. Trees don't usually just walk off with a
    colony of bees inside, So the bees don't really have a built-in, “find my hive” behavior, but they do have a
    behavior for “ the tree my hive was in just got blown over in the wind” alerts. So we can work with this alert
    system and use it to trigger the bees to reorientate.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading" id='helping'>Helping the bees reorientate</h2>

  <p id="reorientate">When moving a hive a short distance, put sticks and branches at the front of the hive to give them
    a reason to
    reorientate. If you don't use something at the entrance of their hive to trigger them into reorientating, the bees
    will fly out of the hive to go foraging and return to the original hive location, not knowing their hive had been
    moved. The bees will begin hovering at the original hive location. Then they will start looking for their “lost”
    hive by flying in ever increasing figure eights, using their sense of smell to find out where their hive is. And if
    you have other hives nearby they may end up trying to go into the closest hive. You can loose a lot of bees this way
    so it is a safer bet to trigger their reorienting pattern once they leave the new hive location. Altering the hive
    entrance with branches may not trigger all of the bees in the colony to reorientate and they will cluster at the old
    location. If this is the case put an empty nuc or swarm box at the old location and wait until night, then close up
    this nuc box and move the bees to the hive at the new location.</p>

  <h2 class="heading no_show" id='move2'>Move the hive yourself (not recomended)</h2>

  <img src="images/hex2.gif" alt="beeKeepers" id="beeKeeper2">

  <p id="moving" class='no_show'>Some folks setup their hive in their yard and for whatever reason they want or need to
    move the hive to a different location. Moving the hive will disrupt the colony for the first day or so. There are
    other ways to get your hive across the yard. Many people are successful moving the hive a foot at night, slowly
    creeping the hive across the yard.
